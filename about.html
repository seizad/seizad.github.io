            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>I’m an independant developer with a passion for building things. Most of my experience is around building web applications and cross platform mobile applications. In addition to pure software development, I have 4 years of experience in a leading role where I led design and development of an enterprise application that went into production use by multiple police departments in less than a year and received the Motorola award for innovation in public safety. </p>
            
            <p>I strive for simplicity and believe it to be the most important factor in achieving perfection. That means building applications that are easy to use and provide a pleasant experience for their users without any unnecessary complexities. </p>

            <p><i>“Perfection is achieved, not when there is no more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” Antoine de Saint-Exupery</i></p>

            <p>It is paramount to keep the client in the loop as much as possible and receive feedback every step of the way. This ensures that the solution will fit the client’s needs as closely as possible. To achieve that I take the following steps:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Work with the client to fully understand the problem</li>
                    <li>Create mockups of the potential solution and work with the client to get feedback and refine it</li>
                    <li>Define milestones in a way that encourages frequent checkpoints to receive feedback</li>
                    <li>Start development and work with the client to deliver</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
