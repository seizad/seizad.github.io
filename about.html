            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>I’m an independant developer with a passion for building things. Most of my experience is around building web applications and cross platform mobile applications. In addition to pure software development, I have 4 years of experience in a leading role where I led design and development of an enterprise application that went into production use by multiple police departments in less than a year and received the Motorola award for innovation in public safety. </p>
            
            <p>I strive for simplicity and believe it to be the most important factor in achieving perfection. That means building applications that are easy to use and provide a pleasant experience for their users without any unnecessary complexities. </p>

            <p><i>“Perfection is achieved, not when there is no more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” Antoine de Saint-Exupery</i></p>
            <br/>

            <h6>My approach to development:</h6>
            <p>Start with understanding the problem. Take as much time necessary to fully understand the objectives of the client. This includes speaking to all stakeholders and finding the answer to all questions that arise. I then mockup in a low fidelity format to quickly gain feedback. Then I move on to high fidelity mockup of the solution to iron out the detail and only after that I start development. This means that my clients are always engaged in the process and provide feedback frequently to ensure project is delivered successfully and meets expectations.</p>
